# Estimated Time to complete

I estimate that I will take 3 hours to complete this project.
It is possible that I may take longer, however I believe it will not take no longer than 5 hours.

## Actual Time to Complete

I begun at 8:20AM
I finished at 9:08AM

## Strategy to complete

Look at the designs and compare it with the backbone html I have written.
Ensure everything is written for all necessary parts of the design with classes and/or ids attached.
Style all elements from the top of the html document go down.
