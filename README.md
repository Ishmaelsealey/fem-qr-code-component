## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt that the mobile design part is what takes me the longest to complete. I estimated 3 hours to complete, however, because I did not have to do a separate set of styles for the mobile design, it took 1 hour to complete.
